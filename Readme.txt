	Endless Runner - Lava and Ice Theme

	Implementation of a 3D game which simulates an endless runner using C++
and OpenGl.
	
	The player uses an ice globe to jump on crates and to avoid lava obstacles.
There are a few characteristics: number of lives, speed and fuel, which have to be
taken into consideration by the player. Each crate has an unique ability depending
on their colour (for example, the white crate enables invincibility while the red one
removes a life). The purpose of the player is to collect as many diamonds that appear
on the road as possbile.
	The game uses textures and lighting elements.
